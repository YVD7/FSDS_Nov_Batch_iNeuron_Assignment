    "Q1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: shutil.copy() methods is used to copy the contents of a file from one file to another file/folder, it primary take two arguments src, dest, src represents the file to be copied where as destination refers to the file / folder to where the src data should copied, if dest is folder name the src the exact name will be   copied to the dest folder, if its a file then the contests of src will be copied to dest where dest retain it name.\n",
    "\n",
    "shutil.copytree() function is used to copy the entire contents of a folder to the other folder. it also takes two arguments src and dest, it copies all the content recursively and stores it in dest. The important catch here is dest must not exist prior to this and it will be created during the copy operation. Permissions and times of directories are copied shutil.copystat() and individual files are copied using shutil.copy2() by default which can be modified using copy_function attributes"
