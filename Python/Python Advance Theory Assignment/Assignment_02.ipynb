    "What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A Python class is like an outline/blueprint/mold for creating a new object. An object is anything that you wish to manipulate or change while working throught the code. Every time a class object is instantiated which is when we delcare a veriable, a new object is initiated from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Where as in Python, Modules are simply files with .py extension containing Python code that can be imported inside another python program. In simple terms, we can consider a module to be the same as a code library or a file that contains a set of functons/ classes that you want to include in your application."

    "How do you make instances and classes?\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans: For creating a class instance. We call a class by it's name and pass arguments which its **`__init__`** method accepts.\n",
