    "**`try`** statement is used for exception handling in python. It consists of a block of risky statements which might cuase an exceptioin during runtime. If code within try block raises exception, then the exception will be reverted to the corresponding exception, then the exception will be reverted to the corresponding except block if multiple except blocks are present, else it will be reverted to the defauld except block. In short try except in union avoid programs from crashing during runtime due to exceptions."
